# Decorators

1. Before you can understand decorators, you must first understand functions. Functions simply return a value based on the given arguments.

2. In Python, functions are first-class objects, so they can be passed around like other values.
3. Again, because of the first-class nature of functions in Python, functions can not only accept other functions as arguments - but return functons are well. *This is a decorator*

# Python OOP

In the world of Object Oriented Programming, *things* are represented as objects. Objects, which are created, or instantiated, by defining classes store data (or fields) as well as associated operations (or methods).


1. Defining a class
2. Class Attributes
3. Initilizer
4. Instance Methods
5. Class Methods
6. Static Methods

## Defining a class

Defining a class is simple:

```python
class Dog(object):
	pass
```

Start with the reserved `class` keyword, then add the name of the class (using CamelCase notation), and then in the parenthesis, add the class you are sublassing or inheriting from. In the example, we are inheriting from the default `object` class.

## Class Attributes




-Create a class for dogs
-The dog should have a method called bark which prints "ruff ruff"
-dogs should have an age property and a name property
-create two dogs, Philo and Mikey
-save this file as dogs.py

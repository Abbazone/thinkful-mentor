# Python List Comprehensions

Before beginning make sure you have a basic understanding of Lists, which are just containers to hold data. Besides basic lists, Python supports a data structure called a "list comprehension", used to construct lists in a natural, easy way. In many cases, a complex task can be constructed using just a single line.

## Part 1: Intro

Letâ€™s start with looking at simple list comprehension. It's common to construct a new list based on values from an existing list after they, say, are filtered by an expression. 

Try this in your shell:

```
>>> numbers = [3, 27, 34, 12, 5]
>>> [num * 3 for num in numbers]
[9, 81, 102, 36, 15]
```

Read this from right to left. We're looping through `numbers`, assigning each indiivdual numbers to the temprary variable, `num`. We're then applying the expression `num * 3`, then apppending each result to a new list.

How would you do this using a regular list construct?

```
>>> numbers = [3, 27, 34, 12, 5]
>>> new_numbers = list()
>>> for num in numbers:
...     new_numbers.append(num * 3)
...
>>> new_numbers
[9, 81, 102, 36, 15]
```

Let's try something a little more advanced.


```python
# intro - ex1a


def create_list(alpha_list):
    beta_list = []
    for letter in alpha_list:
        if filter(letter):
            beta_list.append(letter)
    return beta_list


def filter(letter):
    return letter >= 'B'


alpha_list = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']
print create_list(alpha_list)
```

In this example, we're creating a new list, `beta_list`, of letters greater than or equal to 'B' by iterating through the `alpha_list` and applying the appropriate filter on the list. *This filter is just an expression called a predicate.*

When you run this code you should see:

```
['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']
```

How do we do this with a list comprehension: 

```python
# intro - ex1b


def create_list(alpha_list):
    # Read statements, left to right
    return [letter for letter in alpha_list if filter(letter)]


def filter(letter):
    return letter >= 'B'


alpha_list = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']
print create_list(alpha_list)
```

Run the code. You should see the same output. Now read it outloud, right to left: "return the letter for each letter in `alpha_list` if it's greater than or equal to 'B'". Simple. Concise. Efficient.

## Part 2: Chained vs. Nested Lists

Now that we have a a basic understanding of list comprehensions, let's take it a step further and look at how to chain or combine list comprehensions, which are akin to nested lists - both of which are used for iterating on more than one loop (a loop of loops).

```python
# chained and nested loops - ex2


num_list = [2, 4, 6]
alpha_list = ['A', 'B', 'C']

print "\n# 1) ------------ #\n"

# chain
print ['{}-{}'.format(letter, number) for letter in alpha_list for number in num_list]

# nest
beta_list = []
for letter in alpha_list:
    for number in num_list:
        beta_list.append('{}-{}'.format(letter, number))

print beta_list

print "\n# 2) ------------ #\n"

# chain
print [['{}-{}'.format(letter, number) for letter in alpha_list] for number in num_list]

# nest
beta_list = []
for number in num_list:
    beta_list_inner = []
    for letter in alpha_list:
        beta_list_inner.append('{}-{}'.format(letter, number))
    beta_list.append(beta_list_inner)
print beta_list

print "\n# 3) ------------ #\n"

# chain
print ['{}-{}'.format(letter, number) for letter in alpha_list if letter < 'C' for number in num_list if number < 5]
print ['{}-{}'.format(letter, number) for letter in alpha_list for number in num_list if number < 5 and letter < 'C']


# nest
beta_list = []
for letter in alpha_list:
    if letter < 'C':
        for number in num_list:
            if number < 5:
                beta_list.append('{}-{}'.format(letter, number))
print beta_list

beta_list = []
for letter in alpha_list:
    for number in num_list:
        if number < 5 and letter < 'C':
            beta_list.append('{}-{}'.format(letter, number))
print beta_list
```

Test this out:

```
# 1) ------------ #

['A-2', 'A-4', 'A-6', 'B-2', 'B-4', 'B-6', 'C-2', 'C-4', 'C-6']
['A-2', 'A-4', 'A-6', 'B-2', 'B-4', 'B-6', 'C-2', 'C-4', 'C-6']

# 2) ------------ #

[['A-2', 'B-2', 'C-2'], ['A-4', 'B-4', 'C-4'], ['A-6', 'B-6', 'C-6']]
[['A-2', 'B-2', 'C-2'], ['A-4', 'B-4', 'C-4'], ['A-6', 'B-6', 'C-6']]

# 3) ------------ #

['A-2', 'A-4', 'B-2', 'B-4']
['A-2', 'A-4', 'B-2', 'B-4']
['A-2', 'A-4', 'B-2', 'B-4']
['A-2', 'A-4', 'B-2', 'B-4']
```

So, you can nest a number of list comprehensions inside of one another; however, by doing so, you often sacrafice readability. 

## Part 3: Reversed / Iterators

```python
# reversed / iterators - ex3


alpha_list = ['A', 'B', 'C']

# reversed 
rev_list = list(reversed(alpha_list))
print [i + a for i in alpha_list for a in rev_list]
print [i + a for i in alpha_list for a in reversed(alpha_list)]
rev_old = reversed(alpha_list)
print [i + a for i in alpha_list for a in alpha_list[::-1]]
rev_old = alpha_list[::-1]
print [i + a for i in alpha_list for a in rev_old]
```

Output:

``` 
['AC', 'AB', 'AA', 'BC', 'BB', 'BA', 'CC', 'CB', 'CA']
['AC', 'AB', 'AA', 'BC', 'BB', 'BA', 'CC', 'CB', 'CA']
['AC', 'AB', 'AA', 'BC', 'BB', 'BA', 'CC', 'CB', 'CA']
['AC', 'AB', 'AA', 'BC', 'BB', 'BA', 'CC', 'CB', 'CA']
```

1. In the first example the `reversed()` method creates a generator which we then cast to to a list.
2. In the remaining examples, we're all doing something very similar except we're using list comprehensions to iterate through the generators to create the new lists.

## Part 4 - Dictionary Comprehension

As you probably guessed, a dictionary comprehension is like a list comprehension only it models a dictionary instead of a list.

```python
# dict comps - ex4


num_list = [2, 4, 6]
keys = [1, 3, 5]

print dict((x, y) for x in keys for y in num_list)
print dict(zip(keys, num_list))


class Person(object):
    def __init__(self, id, name):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name

    def __repr__(self):
        return "{} ({})".format(self.name, self.id)

people = [
    Person(1, 'Josh'),
    Person(2, 'Megan'),
    Person(3, 'Ken')
]

print dict([(p.id, p) for p in people])
```

Output:

```
{1: 6, 3: 6, 5: 6}
{1: 2, 3: 4, 5: 6}
{1: Josh (1), 2: Megan (2), 3: Ken (3)}
```


## Conclusion

List comprehension in Python can provide a clear, concise syntax for creating lists from other lists. Just be aware that often more complex lists, especially nested or chained lists can be much more difficult to read using list comprehensions - so you may need to use regular list constructs.

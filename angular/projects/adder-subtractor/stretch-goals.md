1. What happens if someone enters the number *099*? First, you must check for whether a number starts with zero when you validate the entered number. If it does start with a zero, pass it to a `trim()` function to have it removed. *Hint: Use a regular expression.*
1. Create a "backspace" button, so that if someone enters the wrong digit, they can easily remove it without totally starting over.
1. Add the ability to multiply and divide. 
1. Save the last ten calculations. Hide them from the DOM, but allow the user to press a button to view. *Bonus: Store these in your browser's [Local Storage](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/11/local-storage-and-how-to-use-it/).*
1. Refactor your code. 
    - Make it more modular - e.g., break apart different pieces of functionality into different functions. 
    - Look over the names of functions and variables? Do they make sense? Would another developer be able to look at them quickly and grasp what they mean? Do not use abbreviations. They may save time now, but they make your program harder to read and follow not only for someone else, but for the "future" you as well. 
    - Add lots of comments that make it easy to follow. 
    - Convert tabs to spaces. Always use spaces in your programs.
1. Add your source code as a comment in the Google Community forum. Ask someone to review it.
1. Partner with another student. Exchange code. Have each of you implement a feature on the other person's code. This will (a) help you learn how to read and decipher code and (b) see how important it is to write good, clean code with logical variable names and lots of comments.
